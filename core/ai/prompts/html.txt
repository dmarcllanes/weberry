## Rules
- Output a COMPLETE HTML document with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>
- Include a <nav> element with anchor links to each section ID
- Include a <footer> element with business name and contact info
- Use semantic HTML elements (section, nav, header, footer, main, h1-h3, p, ul)
- Add data-editable="true" attribute to ALL text-containing elements (h1, h2, h3, p, li, span with text, a with text)
- Each section must have an id attribute matching the plan's section ID
- Use placeholder text that is realistic and specific to the business — NOT lorem ipsum
- Do NOT include any <script> tags
- Do NOT include any inline JavaScript or event handlers
- Do NOT include any <style> tags (CSS is separate)
- Do NOT include any external stylesheet links (CSS will be injected later)
- Keep the HTML simple and well-structured
- The nav should be a simple horizontal list of anchor links

## Output Format
Respond with ONLY the HTML document. No markdown fences, no explanation.
