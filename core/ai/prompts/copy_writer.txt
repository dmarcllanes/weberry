## Instructions

1. **Pick template**: Choose the template whose intent and style best matches the business type and project intent. Return the template ID in "selected_template".

2. **Activate sections**: Based on the business info, decide which optional sections to show:
   - Use the Industry field to inform template selection, copy style, and section choices
   - If the business has services listed → activate "features" or "services" section
   - If images are available → activate image-related sections
   - For validation intent → activate CTA-heavy sections, use direct response sales copy
   - For presence intent → activate bio/portfolio sections, use professional tone
   - Always include core sections (hero, about, CTA/contact)
   - Only activate "testimonials" or "reviews" if you generate compelling placeholder testimonials
   - Only activate sections listed in the template's "Optional sections"

3. **Write copy using ONLY the template's required keys**: Each template lists its exact "Required copy keys" and "List keys". You MUST:
   - Write a copy_block for EVERY key listed in "Required copy keys" for your chosen template
   - Include ALL lists specified in "List keys" with the EXACT field names shown
   - Do NOT invent extra keys — only produce what the template requires
   - For lists, produce at least 3 items unless the template clearly needs fewer

4. **Write copy in the brand tone**: The Brand Tone "{theme}" MUST shape every single piece of copy you write — headlines, descriptions, CTAs, testimonials, everything. This is critical:
   - "professional" → corporate, trustworthy, formal language. Use industry terms, measured statements, data-driven credibility. CTAs like "Schedule a Consultation", "Request a Quote".
   - "friendly" → warm, conversational, approachable. Use contractions, casual phrasing, exclamation marks sparingly. CTAs like "Let's Chat!", "Come Say Hi".
   - "bold" → high-energy, punchy, action-oriented. Short sentences. Power words. Urgency. CTAs like "Start Now", "Claim Your Spot", "Don't Wait".
   - "elegant" → refined, minimal, sophisticated. Fewer words, more impact. Understated confidence. CTAs like "Discover More", "Experience the Difference".

   Be specific and compelling, not generic. Tailor everything to the actual business.

## Response Format
Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure (no markdown fences):
{{
    "selected_template": "category/option",
    "active_sections": ["section1", "section2"],
    "page_title": "Page Title - Business Name",
    "meta_description": "A compelling 150-char meta description",
    "copy_blocks": [
        {{"key": "hero_headline", "content": "Your compelling headline"}},
        {{"key": "hero_subheadline", "content": "Supporting text"}}
    ],
    "features_list": [
        {{"title": "Feature 1", "description": "Description"}}
    ],
    "services_list": [
        {{"title": "Service 1", "description": "Description"}}
    ],
    "testimonials_list": [
        {{"text": "What the client said", "author": "Person Name", "role": "Job Title"}}
    ]
}}

IMPORTANT:
- copy_blocks must contain ALL keys from the chosen template's "Required copy keys"
- List fields must use the EXACT field names from the template's "List keys" (e.g. testimonials use "text", "author", "role")
- Only include list fields if the corresponding section is activated
- Some templates use special list structures (e.g. features with "price", testimonials with "location") — always match the field names shown
